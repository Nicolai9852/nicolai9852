## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I don't do much on GitHub. But I try to help out with localization in Danish on projects, that I use myself.

## What I have worked on

### Localization
- [OBS Studio](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio)
  - My name is currently not in the AUTHORS.md file, since I deleted my account on Crowdin a while ago. But just search for ["Nicolai9852" across GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=Nicolai9852&type=code) and you will find 300+ forks of OBS Studio, where my name is included.
  - An example of that could be [RPAN Studio](https://github.com/reddit/rpan-studio/blob/master/AUTHORS), which is part of the Reddit Organization
  - I have however returned to translating OBS Studio and hope that it will appear in a future release.
- [Discord](https://discord.com)
  - Discord used to crowdsource their translation until 2018. I was a part of the team, that translated Discord into Danish using Crowdin.
- [Obsidian Plugin: Bible Reference](https://github.com/tim-hub/obsidian-bible-reference/issues/228#issue-2517820554)
  - [Pull Request](https://github.com/Antioch-Tech/bible-reference-toolkit/pull/16)
- [Obsidian Plugin: YouVersion Linker](https://github.com/jaanonim/obsidian-youversion-linker/blob/master/Languages.md)
  - [Pull Request, original](https://github.com/jaanonim/obsidian-youversion-linker/pull/30)
  - [Pull Request, correction](https://github.com/jaanonim/obsidian-youversion-linker/pull/31)
- [Remote Mouse](https://remotemouse.net/specialthanks) (Not a GitHub Repo, nor open source)
